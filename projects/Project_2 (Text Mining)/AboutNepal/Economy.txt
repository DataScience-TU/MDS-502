Nepal's gross domestic product (GDP) for 2019 was $34.186 billion.[179][180]With an annual growth rate calculated at 6.6% in 2019,[181] and expected 2.89% in 2021,[182]Nepal is one of the fastest-growing economies in the world. However, the country ranks 165th in the world[i] in nominal GDP per capita[183] and 162nd[j] in GDP per capita at PPP.[184] Nepal has been a member of WTO since 23 April 2004.[185]

The 16.8-million-worker Nepali labour force is the 37th largest in the world.[186] The primary sector makes up 27.59% of GDP, the secondary sector 14.6%, and the tertiary sector 57.81%.[187] Nepal's foreign exchange remittances of US$8.1 billion in 2018, the 19th largest in the world and constituting 28.0% of GDP,[188] were contributed to its economy by millions of workers primarily in India, the middle east and East Asia, almost all of them unskilled labourers.[189][190] Major agricultural products include cereals (barley, maize, millet, paddy and wheat), oilseed, potato, pulses, sugarcane, jute, tobacco, milk and water buffalo meat.[191][192] Major industries include tourism, carpets, textiles, cigarettes, cement, brick, as well as small rice, jute, sugar and oilseed mills.[191] Nepal's international trade greatly expanded in 1951 with the establishment of democracy; liberalization began in 1985 and picked up pace after 1990. By the fiscal year 2016/17, Nepal's foreign trade amounted Rs 1.06 trillion, a twenty-three folds increase from Rs 45.6 billion in 1990/91. More than 60% of Nepal's trade is with India. Major exports include readymade garment, carpet, pulses, handicrafts, leather, medicinal herbs, and paper products, which account for 90% of the total. Major imports include various finished and semi-finished goods, raw materials, machinery and equipment, chemical fertilizers, electrical and electronic devices, petroleum products, gold, and readymade garments.[193] Inflation was at 4.5% in 2019.[194] Foreign exchange reserves were at US$9.5 billion in July 2019, equivalent to 7.8 months of imports.[194]


Two-thirds of the Nepali workforce is employed in agriculture but productivity is low, as most of it is done with traditional methods and manual labour.
Nepal has made significant progress in poverty reduction bringing the population below the international poverty line (US$1.90 per person per day) from 15% in 2010 to just 9.3% in 2018, although vulnerability remains extremely high, with almost 32% of the population living on between US$1.90 and US$3.20 per person per day.[194] Nepal has made improvement in sectors like nutrition, child mortality, electricity, improved flooring and assets. Under the current trend, Nepal is expected to eradicate poverty within 20 years.[195][196] The agriculture sector is particularly vulnerable as it is highly dependent on the monsoon rains, with just 28% of the arable land being irrigated, As of 2014.[197] Agriculture employs 76% of the workforce, services 18%, and manufacturing and craft-based industry 6%.[198] Private investment, consumption, tourism and agriculture are the principal contributors to economic growth.[194]

The government's budget is about $13.71 billion (FY 2019/20);[199] expenditure of infrastructure development budget, most of it contributed by foreign aid, usually fails to meet the target.[200] The country receives foreign aid from the UK,[201][202] India, Japan, the US, the EU, China, Switzerland, and Scandinavian countries. The Nepali rupee has been tied to the Indian rupee at an exchange rate of 1.6 for many years. Per capita income is $1,004.[203] The distribution of wealth among the Nepalis is consistent with that in many developed and developing countries: the highest 10% of households control 39.1% of the national wealth and the lowest 10% control only 2.6%. European Union (EU) (46.13%), the US (17.4%), and Germany (7.1%) are its main export partners; they mainly buy Nepali ready-made garments (RMG).[204] Nepal's import partners include India (47.5%), the United Arab Emirates (11.2%), China (10.7%), Saudi Arabia (4.9%), and Singapore (4%).

Besides having landlocked, rugged geography, few tangible natural resources and poor infrastructure, the ineffective post-1950 government and the long-running civil war are also factors in stunting the country's economic growth and development.[205][206][207] Debt bondage even involving debtors' children has been a persistent social problem in the western hills and the Terai, with an estimated 234,600 people or 0.82% of the population considered as enslaved, by The Global Slavery Index in 2016.[208]

Tourism

Main article: Tourism in Nepal
Tourism is one of the largest and fastest-growing industries in Nepal, employing more than a million people and contributing 7.9% of the total GDP.[209] The number of international visitors crossed one million in 2018 for the first time (not counting Indian tourists arriving by land).[209][210] Nepal's share of visitors to South Asia is about 6%, and they spend much less on average, with Nepal sharing 1.7% of the earnings.[211] Premier destinations include Pokhara, the Annapurna trekking circuit and the four UNESCO world heritage sitesâ€”Lumbini, Sagarmatha National Park (home to Mount Everest), seven sites in the Kathmandu Valley collectively listed as one, and Chitwan National Park. Most of Nepal's mountaineering earning comes from Mount Everest, which is more accessible from the Nepalese side.

Nepal, officially opened to westerners in 1951, became a popular destination at the end of the hippie trail, during the 1960s and 1970s. The industry, disrupted by the civil war in the 1990s, has since recovered but faces challenges to growth, owing to a lack of proper facilities for high-end tourism termed the "infrastructure bottleneck", the flag carrier in shambles, and a handful of destinations properly developed and marketed. The home-stay tourism, in which cultural and eco-tourists stay as paying guests in the homes of indigenous people, has seen some success.[212]

Foreign employment

While adults are employed in slavery-like conditions abroad, hundreds of thousands of children in the country are employed as child labour (not including the agricultural sector).
The rate of unemployment and underemployment exceeds half of the working-age population,[213] driving millions to seek employment abroad, mainly in India, the Gulf, and East Asia. Mostly unskilled, uneducated, and indebted to loan sharks, these workers are swindled by the manpower companies and sent to exploitative employers or war-ridden countries under fraudulent contracts.[214][215] They have their passports seized, to be returned when the employer grants them leave or terminates their contracts. Most do not get paid minimum wage,[216] and many are forced to forfeit all or part of the wages.[217] Many Nepalis work in extremely unsafe conditions; an average of two workers die each day.[218] Due to restrictions placed on women, many depend on traffickers to get out of the country, and end up victims of violence and abuse.[219] Many Nepalese are believed to be working under slavery-like conditions, and Nepal spends billions of rupees rescuing stranded workers, on remuneration to the indebted families of the dead, and in legal costs for those arrested in foreign countries.[220][221] Though millions have raised themselves out of poverty, due to a lack of entrepreneurial skills, the remittance is largely spent on real estate and consumption.[222][221]
